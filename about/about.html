        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We are Divyansh, Minjun, and Mustafa, upper-year computer science students at the University of Toronto Scarborough. We chose the CSCB20 course to excel in web development skills and have decided to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a project for this course. For Assignment 2, we have been tasked with designing a mock-up website for Okayreads.com, which will display the main functionality of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Website Requirements:
Our website must include a navigation menu that sticks to the left side of the window in full screen or across the top of the screen in mobile view. It must also have a footer that sticks to the bottom of the page, displaying the names of all team members who designed the page. The main page should contain five books of the week with images of each book. Additionally, there should be a page for each book of the week that provides details and a summary of the book. Users should be able to add a review of the book, and there should be a page that allows users to log in to the website. An admin page should only appear if the login name is "admin," allowing the user to set the order in which the books of the week appear on the main page. Finally, there should be a page that lists all the reviews of users for each book.

            How We Implemented It:

            How We Implemented It:
We used VS Code to set up the whole project. The initial interface starts with a login page. All the fields, including the username, password, and checkbox, are mandatory for the user to fill in before entering. If the user is an admin, the page will redirect to the admin page. If the user is a regular user, it will redirect to the dashboard. The JavaScript system checks for the admin username and password, which are "admin" and "password," respectively.

            For the admin, they have the option to see the feedback form and add new books, authors, and summaries, along with an image that replaces the original one. There is also an option to reorder the IDs of the books.
        </p>
        <p>
            For regular users, the dashboard displays four options: to see all the books, search for a book, fill out a feedback form, and visit the About Us page section. Users can see all five books visible and navigate through them using the navigation bar. They can also search for a specific book they want. Users can provide feedback on the book through a feedback form. This feedback is sent to the administration, and the admin has the option to reply to them and delete reports if necessary.
